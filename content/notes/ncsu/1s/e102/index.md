## Enhancing Virtual Reality

Virtual reality is all about simulating reality so we can have more control in
*education*, *training*, *entertainment*, and even more scenarios.

Currently, the main components are **goggles/headsets**,
**headphones/earbuds**, and **movement sensors**. In the future,
**omnidirectional treadmills**, **touch simulators**, and possibly other tools
will become part of the standard VR toolset.

This has connections to [personalizing learning](#Advance Personalized Learning)

* Important People:
  * Jaron Lanier

## Advance Personalized Learning

* Big Ideas:
  * **People are different**
  * **Motivation**
  * Let students move at their own rate.
  * We collect more data to figure out how students learn, what they are
    learning, and how to better help them. (machine learning and data
    science???)
  * Get quick feedback from immediate assessment to send help people.
  * Figure out what students are interested in and use that to help keep them
    interesting.
* *Why is it important?*
  * We need educated people for almost everything.
  * Our education system kinda sucks.
  * We have a shit ton of people drop out.
* Connections:
  * Personalized Medicine: Using data.
  * Reverse Engineer the Brain: How does it work?
  * Enhancing Virtual Reality: Cool new way to teach!

## Carbon Sequestration

* Chemical Engineering's most important and personal grand challenges.
* Scrubber: Removes $CO_2$ from gas.
  * Types: Wet gas scrubber.
* US Expected Cost from Climate Change: 20\$ trillion.
  * 2nd highest in the world.
* Current Solutions: Shift energy sources, land management, carbon injection, biochar/biomass, rock
  storage.
* Current Issues: Which solution should we do? God it's so expensive. No solution is very good so
  far.
  * Carbon Tax: Companies lobby against it because they don't want to spend it.

## Manage the Nitrogen Cycle

* Sustainability: Maintaining balance of resource use in environment.
* Things that Add Nitrogen to Ground: Legumes (nitrogen fixing root nodules),
  fertilizer, nitrifying bacteria.
* Things that Remove Nitrogen from Ground: Denitrifying bacteria, soil leaching
  (water), plant roots.
* *How does nitrogen get added by humans?* Primarily creating nitrogen based
  fertilizer and disrupting ecosystems (killing nitrogen providing legumes).
* *Why is the nitrogen cycle important?* Because nitrous oxide is a very strong
  greenhouse gas and nitrogen can get into water (from runoff) and ruin aquatic
  ecosystems (fish kills, eutrophication, algal blooms).

## Reverse-Engineering the Brain

* Impacts:
  * Cure/help neurological diseases.
  * Advance computing.
  * Understanding humans.
  * Advances in prosthetics.

## Health Informations

* Health Informations: The acquisition, management, and use of data in health and medical setting.
* Very closely related with engineering better medicines. *How can you create better medicine if
  you don't have info?*

## Preventing Nuclear Terror

* Currently, our "best" method of preventing nuclear terror is Mutually Assured
* Destruction (MAD), which is a shit method.
* Three parts to using nuclear weapons.
  * Obtaining nuclear materials - *The hardest one*.
    * Uranium 235, Plutonium 239 are used because they are fissile (can sustain
      chain reactions).
    * You get plutonium 239 from a breeder reactor (creates it) and uranium 235
      from enrichment.
  * Obtaining a detonation method.
  * Delivering the weapons.
* Solutions:
  * Systems for tracking nuclear materials and weapons.
  * Nuclear car wash.
  * Computer modeling of nuclear attacks to guide warning systems and clean up.

### Anatomy of Nuclear Weapons/Reactor

* For a weapon to work, a reaction needs to be supercritical.
* Subcritical: Not enough neutrons are released to sustain the reaction. *Dies
  out.*
* Critical: Just enough neutrons to release to sustain the reaction. *Self
  sustains.*
* Supercritical: More neutrons are released than need to sustain the reaction.
  *Goes boom.*
* Types of Nuclear Assemblies / Detonators:
  * Gun type: A conventional explosive to the side of two nuclear pieces
    explodes and pushes the two pieces together. Can only be used for uranium
    235.
  * Implosion type: A conventional explosive surrounds the nuclear material and
    explodes, compressing the nuclear material. Can be used for everything.
* Enriching uranium 235: You use mass separation. This is normally done now by
  gaseous centrifuging, since uranium 235 is lighter than normal uranium 239.
* Breeding plutonium 239: Basically there is a series of nuclear processes that
  convert uranium 238 to plutonium 239.
  * Normal reactors create plutonium 240, which can't be used for nuclear
    weapons because it blows itself up before it goes supercritical.

## Restore Urban Infrastructure

* *Why security?* Urban infrastructure impacts the safety/stability of society as a whole.
  * Think Flint, Michigan and the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse.
* Issues:
  * US gets a D+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers
* *Why is it hard?*
  * It's really expensive
  * It isn't sexy.
  * People don't see the benefit.
