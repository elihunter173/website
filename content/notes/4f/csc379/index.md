# Basics

Ethical theories are split into three general areas: **meta-ethics**,
**normative ethics**, and **applied ethics**.

* Ethical Principles
  * Beneficence: Do good to someone or a group.
  * Least Harm: Do not harm people.
  * Respect for Autonomy: Let people make their own choices.
  * Justice: People receive what they deserve in a sense.
* Ethical Theories:
  * Deontological: Uses a set of rules to distinguish right from wrong. For
    example, "Don't lie. Don't steal. Don't cheat".
  * Utilitarian: Has the concept of a **utility function**, which may depend on
    the situation. Your goal is to maximize the utility function.
  * Rights: List of rights people have universally. You judge the ethics of a
    situation based on whether it respects or infringes on these rights.
  * Virtues: You think about about what a virtuous person would do.

Here are some frameworks for making decisions:
* Consequentialist: Consider future effects.
* Duty: Duties and obligations of situation.
* Virtue: Consider character traits that motivate us.
