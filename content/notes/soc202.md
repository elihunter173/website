# Administrivia

* No final exam. Just a final semi-independent project.
* Grades on Moodle.
* No late work.
* No more than 2 absences. 3 tardies = 1 absence.
* Notes for day uploaded at start of class.

# Terms

* Sociology: Science of human social behavior and individuals interaction with
  society.
* Sociological Imagination/Perspective: Ability to see relation between
  individual lives and society at large. Specifically dealing with troubles and
  issues.
* Diversity: Abstract concept of the variety of experiences of members in a
  group.
* Positivism: The scientific method, where knowledge and inquiry is above all.
* Ethnography: Study done using observation and interviews.

## Sociological Concepts

It is important to realize society changes people and people change society.

* Social Interaction: Meaningful behavior involving 2+ people.
* Social Structure: Organized pattern for relationships and institutions that
  make up a society. Common social forces of society.
* Social Institutions: Organized system of social behaviors with a specific
  purpose. (e.g. marriage, government, family)
  * Unlike individual behavior, this cannot be directly observed.
* Social Organization: Order established within social groups. A structured
  system/pattern of social relationships in a group of people. This makes
  society *easier to understand*.
  * Formal Social Organizations: Goal directed. Military, universities, hospitals.
  * Informal Social Organizations: Not goal directed. Friend groups, individual
    relationships, social groups.
* Social Change: The change society experiences over time for any reason.
  * This can be motivated to attempt to cause significant transformation of
    behavior patterns, social institutions, and cultural values. This is called
    *applied sociology* normally.
* Structural Effects: Pushes on individuals from society.
* Cultural Capital: Skills, behaviors, and experiences that can change your lot
  (can benefit or harm you). Everyone has cultural capital but the type/quality
  of it depends. Examples include speech style, education, negotiation
  abilities, self advocacy, discipline.

### Societal Concepts

* Issues: Largely felt troubles coming form a common origin in society. Hard to
  pinpoint specific cause.
  * Synonyms: Public Issues of Social Structure.
  * Parallel: Troubles.
* Structure: Social systems that constrain actions of individuals.
  * Parallel: Agency.
* Context: Setting for a society.
  * Parallel: Social Context
* Macroscopic/Large-Scale Social Phenomena: Groups, organizations, cultures,
  society, the world, and the relationships among them.
  * Parallel Microscopic ...

### Individual Concepts

* Troubles: Privately felt difficulties
  * Synonyms: Personal Troubles of Mileau (i.e. social setting of troubles)
  * Parallel: Issues.
  * Examples: Divorce (rate), student loan debt, unemployment (in
  recession/depression), obesity.
* Agency: Capacity to act independently.
  * Parallel: Structure.
* Social Context: Influence of society on individuals.
  * Parallel: Context.
* Microscopic/Small-Scale Social Phenomena: Individuals and their thoughts and
  actions.
  * Parallel Macroscopic ...

# People

See page 19 of "Sociology: The Essentials, 9th ed." for a table. All people
here discussed American society.

* Alexis de Tocqueville (1805–1859): French man. "Tyranny of the majority".
* Harriet Martineau (1802–1876): British woman. Wrote "Society in America
  (1937)".
* Jane Addams (1860-1935): White woman. Leader in "settlement house movement"
  and other movements to help poor and immigrants.
* Ida B. Wells-Barnett (1862–1931): Black woman; born a slave. Leader of
  anti-lynching movement and women's and black's rights.
* W. E. B. DuBois (1868-1963): Black man. Founder of NAACP (National
  Association for the Advancement of Colored People).
* C. Wright Mills (1916-1962): "Sociological imagination".

# Sociological Research

Broadly research involves a **puzzle** and **idea**.

* Puzzle: Research Question
* Idea: Hook or twist to research question. What makes your research unique.

Sociologists generally don't replicate a study unless a previous research study
had questionable practices. (This is rationalized because of peer review) If
there is replication, there tends to be a "twist" and researches themselves
will recommend twists.

Sociological research tends to be split between quantitative and qualitative.
Here's a broad overview:

* Quantitative:
  * Deductive (theory/hypotheses to research)
  * Methods: surveys, polls, structured questionnaires, experiments (i.e.
    numerical data)
  * Asks: relate, effect, cause, impact
  * Broad
  * Generalizable
* Qualitative:
  * Inductive (research to theory/hypotheses)
  * Methods: participant observation, focus groups, in-depth interviews (i.e.
    text-based data)
  * Asks “what” or “how”
  * Deep
  * Not generalizable

It is important to note that sociological research tends to have values that
can impact their research (see **positionality**). This positionality is more
impactful for qualitative research.

To try to combat positionality, sociologists (especially qualitative) tend to
be very reflective, describing their position and history and how that may
impact their research.

## Quantitative Research

Quantitative research seeks to create associations/correlations and uses
hypotheses. Actual numbers and counts (of groups) are used; numbers are often
hard to get, so we can be pretty liberal.

To show causality, sociologists only must only show the following to a
reasonable person.

* Correlation: We need to see them together.
* Temporal Ordering: We need to know that our independent variable occurs
  before our dependent variable.
* Non-Spuriousness: The relationship makes sense / isn't caused by anything
  else.

As you can see, sociologists are pretty liberal. Their requirements are sound
in theory, but it's hard to prove non-spuriousness in practice without
experiments, which we can't (normally) do because of ethics.

Quantitative research normally uses surveys, polls, structured questionnaires,
experiments (i.e., numerical data).

Quantitative research tends to be easy to generalize.

### Examples

Does critical thinking ability relate to student achievement?

Is there a relationship between neighborhood type (e.g. residential, business
district) and types of crimes committed (e.g. car theft, robbery)?

## Qualitative Research

Qualitative research seeks to understand individual people's *perceptions* of
their *experiences*, what *meaning* people attribute to themselves, and the
*social processes* that help form their lives.

There are no hypotheses and it is very individual and touchy-feely. It's a lot
like case-studies except normal.

Qualitative research tends to be very exploratory, where people start with a
central question that spawns sub-questions.

Normally works with **symbolic interaction** on the **micro level**.

Qualitative research normally uses participant observation, focus groups,
in-depth interviews (i.e. text-based data)

Qualitative research tends to be hard to generalize.

### Examples

What are the experiences of minority students in predominantly white
educational institutions?

How do parents discuss sex and sexuality with early adolescent girls and boys?

## Themes

* (Social) Diversity: The variety of group experiences that come from social
  structure.
  * Group differences in opportunities
  * Shaping of social institutions by various factors.
* (Social) Inequality: Ways social categories are differentially positioned
  with social goods (e.g. labor market, education, healthcare, political
  representation, etc.)
* Globalization: Increased economic, political, and social connectedness and
  interdependence among societies around the world.
  * Pros: More access to goods and services, shared technology, etc.
  * Cons: Job displacement, pollution impacts, "deviant globalization"
    (terrorism, sex trafficking, black market, etc.)
  * Causes: Internet, container ships, airplanes.

## "Levels" of Study

* Personal Level (micro): Studying individual people
  * Examples: symbolic interaction, family conflict, aging
* Societal Level (macro): Examine whole semi-homogeneous group.
  * Examples: crime and law, poverty and wealth, social movements
* Global Level (macro): Examine whole world.
  * Examples: war and peace, global economy
  * Increasingly similar to societal level.

## Ethics

Here are some examples of ethical controversies:

* Philip Zimbardo: Stanford Prison Experiment (1971)
  * Issue: Students did not have **informed consent**. There may have been long
    term effects of study on student.
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment>
* Federal Government: [Tuskegee Syphilis Study] (1932-1972)
  * Meant to last 6 months. Lasted for 40 years!
  * Issue: Men did not have **informed consent**. Their syphilis was not cured
    there being a cure.
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment>
* Laud Humphreys': [Tearoom Trade Study] (1965-1968)
  * Issue: Men did not know they were being studied (no **informed consent**).
    He **deceived** the participants. Collected **personal information** on
    participants. Did follow up studies again **deceiving** the participants.
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tearoom_Trade>
* Mark Regnerus: Study on Same-Sex Parenting (2012)
  * Issue: **Conflict of interest**, funded by anti-LGBTQ groups. Had
    troublesome research practices.

As a reaction, we have the following *informal* ethical principles.

* Respect for Persons: Treat individuals as autonomous people, protecting
  children and others with diminished-autonomy.
* Beneficence: Minimize harm to studied individuals (and everyone) and
  maximize the benefits to studied individuals (and everyone)
* Justice: Benefits and harms should be distributed justly/fairly equally

Also, every institution that does research on humans must have an institutional
review board (IRB) that reviews research proposals, that apply common ethical
standards. Researches cannot begin until the IRB approves.

### Common Ethical Standards

* Achieve Valid Results: Your research is meant to get correct info.
* Ensure Honesty and Openness: Scientists must disclose their methods and
  honest in presenting their finding.
* Protect Research Participants:
  * **Do no harm** to participants.
  * Participants must be **anonymous**, unless explicitly waived with informed
    consent.
  * Benefits should outweigh risks.
* Informed Consent:
  * Participants must know how and why the research is being done, unless them
    knowing prevents the study.

## Peer Review

All research must go through peer review process. The peer review process is
when you send your paper to a board. They give you feedback and one of the
following happens:

* Your paper is rejected.
* Your paper is temporarily rejected with feedback.
* Your paper is accepted.

## Finding and Parsing Research

In this class, we will only look at peer-reviewed articles from NC State's
database which were published by sociological journals.

You can search for you topic, filtering for only peer-reviewed articles, and
then scour for one published by a journal. Or you can search in all for
sociological journals. Then, pick the one you want, and go directly to the
journal's website.

You can also use Google Scholar, find what you want, and then look for it on NC
State's libraries.

When reading articles, *always read the abstract first*.

## Citations

When you summarize or paraphrase work, provide the author's names and year of
publication.

> Gender inequality... (West and Zimmerman 2009)

When directly quoting, include author's name, year of publication, and page
numbers from work within directly after the quote.

> Firebaugh argues "..." (Firebaugh 2008:50)

If you have works with several authors, you cite every author the first time
and then just the first author "et al.".

# Purpose of Sociology

* Scientific / Descriptivist View: Just describe and investigate society's
  structure.
* Social Reform / Prescriptivist View: Take the results of research into
  society's relationship and use it to solve social problems.
* Hybrid: You do both! How much? It's a spectrum.

# Debates

## Agency vs Structure

* Do people act as free agents or as a social structure? It's hard to determine
  and seems to depend! I tend to think structure.

# Theories

Sociology theory arose during the 1800s because of and with industrialization
and urbanization. (A lot of things were changing!)

## Social Construction of Reality Theory (SCT)

* Social Construction: Social mechanism, phenomenon, and category created and
  developed by society. These are jointly constructed using shared assumptions
  about reality.
  * These do not strictly exists biologically (although are often linked).
  * Examples: Gender, race

How can you tell what is a social construction? There are examples of societies
that have different social constructions or it is comprehensible that there
exists a society with different social constructions.

How do we get these? Media, family, history, agriculture(!), etc.

Sociologists consider (our perception of) reality a social construction (i.e.
**social construction of reality theory**) because we learn and comprehend a
lot about reality via language and communication, which is a social
construction. This is just a **HOT** way to say that you get biases from your
culture/upbringing/society that you hold to be fundamental truths being
constantly reaffirmed due to confirmation bias and self-fulfilling prophecies.
(There is no reality! Hahaha.)

The concept of a **shared social reality** is said to be the commonly held
social constructions in a group that helps form the basis of a society and hold
them together.

### Examples

A poorer, more crime-heavy neighborhood gets randomly frisked and high levels
of police surveillance. This neighborhood things police are a good thing. A
richer, less crime-heavy neighborhood rarely gets bothered by police and only
sees them when there is a severe issue. This neighborhood thinks police are a
good thing.

We assume there are only two genders that are completely linked with sex.
(Wait, I thought sex and gender are the same? Exactly! Sex is a physical thing;
gender is a social thing.)

## Functionalism (Macro)

They are optimistic about inequality and believe it helps us.

The core **assumption** is that society is like a living organism. Each part
has a function and purpose and society needs all parts to survive.

Belief that inequality/stratification is inevitable and functional for society
because social inequality motivates people to fill different positions in
society that are necessary.

* Social Cohesion: Degree to which those in social system identify with it,
  feel bound to it, and are willing to cooperate in a society.
* Social Facts: Social patterns external to individuals (e.g. customs).
* Functions: Positive consequence of a structure. Help society.
  * Family: raise kids, provide micro support structure, help create and
    prolong society (values, language, etc.).
* Dysfunctions: Negative consequence of a structure. Harm society.
  * Border Control: Can split families, harm innocent people (especially
    unfairly).

### People

* Auguste Comte (1798–1857): French man. Pioneered "sociology" and
  "positivism".
* Emile Durkheim (1858-1917): Jewish, French man. "[Functionalism]" and "[sui
  generis]" (society is greater than the sum of its part). Interested
  anti-Semitism unifying people.

## Conflict Theory (Macro)

They are pessimistic about inequality and believe it is inevitable and harms
us. Basically, "If we could just solve inequality...".

This theory was brought around mostly because of capitalism and is focused
mostly on the economy and capitalism. Focuses heavily on class struggle.

The belief that struggle over scare resources leads to inequality. Inequality
leads to conflict and unequal power distribution, some dominating others.

Why wasn't Marx (and conflict theory) right?
* It was, kinda.
* Not just class/economics that separate people (e.g. racism).
* Revolts are dangerous.
* We have the "American Dream".
* Globalization and technology is like WOAH. The online shopping,
  containerization, and the Internet has made a lot of the assumptions for a
  healthy market **ABSURDLY** more accurate.

* Power: Ability to control others, events, and resources. General ability to
  make things happen.
* (Social) Classes: Different groups of society, separated economically.
  * Capitalist (or Bourgeoisie): Rich large business owners. Oppressors.
  * Petty Bourgeoisie: Small business owners.
  * Proletariat (or Working Class): Workers. Oppressed.
  * Lumpenproletariat: Those discarded by capitalism (e.g. homeless).
* Class Struggle: Capitalists driven to decrease wages of workers. Workers want
  high wages. This causes struggle.
* Rationalization: Act of social structures becoming more direct and efficient.
  * Pros:
    * Fewer people need to work.
    * We have more stuff in less time.
    * Can have less human error.
  * Cons:
    * Fewer people have jobs.
    * Job displacement (altho only an issue in capitalism).
    * Stressful.
    * Environment can get hurt.
    * Less interaction with people.
    * People get comfortable being isolated.
  * Examples:
    * Consumers increasingly are doing more work (pumping gas, bagging
      groceries). "Consumer workers".

### People

* Karl Marx (1818-1883):
  * Analyzed society economically.
* Max Weber (Vay-Ber) (1864-1920):
  * Analyzed society and power with political, economic, and cultural
    (religious) dimensions.
  * Created "verstehen" (understanding social actions from those who do them).
  * Connected economy and religion, showing that protestant economies tend to
    be more successful (fluke?).
  * Created rationalization.

### Symbolic Interactionism (Micro)

Assumes that interaction and communication is extremely important.

Focuses on how people interact, the meaning of certain symbols/statements, and
how those symbols/statements affect people.

## Dramaturgy (Instance of SCT)

Created by **Goffman**. Models social interaction as a drama/theater, with a
**front stage** and a **back stage**. Where, during the front stage, we try to
manage and manipulate others' impressions of us, while, during the back stage,
we don't care.

* Front Stage: When we're interacting with people.
* Back Stage: When we're not interacting with other people.

This is similar to the **looking glass self** theory, where we always consider
other people's impressions of you, which impacts your behavior.

# Socialization

* Socialization: How an individual learns and accepts the way their
  society/group works. Lifelong process of learning the expectations, values,
  norms, and roles of a culture. How an individual learns their "place" in
  society.

Socialization is split into childhood / **primary** and **adult**
socialization.

Primary socialization is how newborns and young children acquire language,
identities, and culture (routines, norms, and values). This is chiefly
responsible for transforming children into prepared adults (called
**anticipatory socialization**). Parents and the family unit are responsible
for this.

For the longest time, primary socialization was assumed to be one-direction,
from parent to child. Recent research shows that this is two-directional. This
is most easily seen by children of immigrants teaching and exposing their
parents to the language and culture of their new home. Additionally with
technology. This backflow is called **reverse socialization**.

Adult socialization occurs with peers (and also children). Generally, this is
people slowly evolving in a changing society. The most common change is
changing your "presentation of self". Adult socialization can also occur with
**resocialization**, where people have to *unlearn* their old behaviors, norms,
and culture and learn new ones. This occurs most in **total institutions**,
which are closed off enclaves of culture (e.g. military and prison).

## Nature vs Nurture

Sociologists tend to believe nurture plays a very large role. They don't
believe in "human nature" in general (i.e. women want to have children). They
believe most human behavior is shaped strongly by socialization and the
environment.

## Agents of Socialization

There are many things that socialize you. Here's a quick breakdown:

* Family: Basic introduction into family and societal culture (i.e. tasks,
  rituals, beliefs, gender, social-class, etc.). There are noticeable class and
  racial differences.
* Schools: Teachers have implicit biases and beliefs that their students are
  exposed to ("hidden curriculum"). Gender roles become more extreme here due
  to exposure to other people in the same age and the "hidden curriculum" (e.g.
  boys line up here, girls play with these toys, etc.).
* Peers: Your peers beliefs amplify and affect your beliefs. Acting as an "echo
  chamber".
* Media: Beliefs are spread widely and talked as though generally accepted.
* Religion: Religions have their own culture, beliefs, and norms.

## Theories of Socialization

Here's a quick breakdown:

* Psychoanalytic Theory:
  * Created by Sigmund Freud
  * Focuses on the unconscious.
  * Pretty wack, not really covered.
* Social Learning Theory ("Role Modeling"):
  * Like "behaviorism" from sociology.
  * Says formation of identity is a learned both by modeling your actions and
    beliefs after others and by changing your beliefs and actions based on
    people's reactions to them.
  * Behavior exhibited by many people is more likely to be repeated.
  * Behavior that is positively reinforced is more likely to be repeated.
  * Sociologists use different terms from psychologists because ugh:
    * Positive Reinforcement: Good!
    * Negative Reinforcement: Bad!
* Functionalism:
  * Socialization is how people are *integrated* into society and how society
    maintains *stability*.
  * Focus on social consensus and conformity.
* Conflict Theory:
  * View socialization as a way to *perpetuate the status quo*.
  * People learn to accept the current system and their social status rather
    than challenge them.
* Symbolic Interaction (SI) Theory:
  * Recall symbolic interaction theory focuses on the self and interactions
    between individuals.
  * Focuses on the concept of "self", which is socially built and reinforced.
  * There are many different SI theories.

### Symbolic Interaction (SI) Theories

* Cooley's - The "Looking-Glass Self":
  * A lot like social learning theory. Explains that formation of self is a
    social process based on your interactions with other people.
  * The "looking-glass self" is our understanding of how other people perceive
    and judge us.
* Mead's Theory of Socialization:
  * Argued that social roles are the basis of social interaction.
  * Argues identity emerged from the roles you play in the following stages:
    * Imitation Stage: Child copies the roles of others without understanding
      them.
      * Children cursing
    * Play Stage: Children take the roles of people in the environment, but
      only one at a time. Understand their roles *relationships* with other
      people.
      * Playing "House", "Cops and Robbers"
    * Game Stage: Children become capable of understanding and playing multiple
      roles. Children get a **generalized other**, which is the abstract
      composition of all your roles in every situation. Has two dimensions, the
      active, self-defining "I", the passive, defined "Me".

# Culture

Culture refers to

* shared system of beliefs, knowledge, meanings, and symbols
* shared forms of communication
* set of values, beliefs, and practices

There are **non-material** parts of culture: norms, laws, customs, ideas, and
beliefs. There are **material** parts of culture: money, technology, and
houses.

Culture is learned, shared, common, and taken for granted.

Culture is made up of a few fundamental elements:

* Values: Standards defining what is good, desirable, right, important, and
  vice versa.
* Norms: Informal, unwritten rules that guide how people live. Sometimes
  combined with laws.
* Laws: Codified rules that enforce how people live. Sometimes combined with
  norms.
* Beliefs: Shared ideas believed collectively to be true.
* Language: Actual, real language. Set of meaningful symbols allowing
  communication. Allows for the spreading and storage of culture.

## Norms

Norms are reinforced with **sanctions**, which can be either punishments, when
norms are violated, or rewards, when norms are followed.

**Mores** are extremely important, heavily punished norms (tend to be laws).
**Folkways** are unimportant norms that are not heavily punished.

## Different Culture within a Society

There can be many different cultures within a society! There is the **dominant
or mainstream culture**, which is the culture of the most powerful group (also
tends to be the largest). This mainstream culture tends to be considered the
"most correct" or "most legitimate" that other subcultures do not have.
**Subcultures** are any cultures within a society that are not the mainstream
culture. They have to different from mainstream culture in some significant
way, but they don't have to be totally incompatible. Any extreme, far-leaning
political or religious groups can be categorized as subcultures. Some examples
are Amish, LGTBQ+, and polyamorists. **Counter-culture** is similar to
subculture except their culture tends to actively and vocally reject mainstream
cultures and they can often impact/change mainstream culture. Examples include
Alt-Right, Antifa, (old) LGBTQ+, and the civil rights movement.

In America, rich, politicians, and celebrities "define" the mainstream culture.
This also tends to be white, upper-middle class culture in America.

## Analyzing Other Cultures

* Ethnocentrism: Tendency to analyze other cultures using your own culture as a
  "normal standard".

* Cultural Relativism: Belief that something can only be understood and judged
  in relation to the cultural context in which appears.

# Social Structure & Interaction

* Society: A system of social interaction. Typically geographically based with
  interdependence among people.
* Social Interaction: Behavior between people with a meaning. Helps form social
  bonds. **Foundation of society**.
* Social Organization: Order established within social groups. A structured
  system/pattern of social relationships in a group of people. This makes
  society *easier to understand*.
  * Formal Social Organizations: Goal directed. Military, universities, hospitals.
  * Informal Social Organizations: Not goal directed. Friend groups, individual
    relationships, social groups.
* Social Institution: Established, organized system of social behavior with a
  recognized purpose.
  * Great example of functionalism.
  * Examples: Family, education, religion, government, work, economy, sports,
    mass media.
* Social Structure: Underlying pattern of interaction and social relationships.
  Can both enable and confine someone. *Society is made up of social
  structures*.
  * Examples: Social class (access to goods), economy, the government.
* Status: Established **position** in social structure, carrying certain rank,
  value, and meaning.
  * Achieved Status: Attained through effort.
  * Ascribed Status: Assigned from the features of the person. Had from the
    moment of birth.
  * Master Status: The most dominant status that a person has. Generally
    overrides all other statuses.
* Role: **Behavior** others expect from a person in a status.
  * Example: Police, students, professors, doctors, men, women.

People try to study society at two levels: macro and micro. Macro level studies
an entire society, looking for large patterns, often simplifying certain
things. Micro level focuses on individuals, analyzing patterns within a single
person's life.

*Why do we form a society?* Well, there's a lot of reasons, but broadly we say
it is necessary because of **solidarity**.

## (Durkheim's) Social Solidarity

* Mechanical Solidarity:
  * Social cohesions from homogeneity of people.
  * Everyone plays similar roles (hunter-gatherer societies)
  * Social bonds based on common sentiments and morality.
  * *Became less important as society grew*.
  * **I'm pretty sure this has never actually been important**.
* Organic Society
  * People *specialize* and play a variety of roles.
  * Unity is based on **need of other people's specialties**.
  * "Division of Labor"

## Interaction

Interaction occurs between a collection of interconnected **social groups**. In
these groups, people communicate, have common goals/norms, and has a subject
sense of "we".

**Note:** Categories, people with some common features, aren't necessarily
social groups.

## Formal Organizations

There are broadly 3 categories

* Normative Organizations: Voluntary organizations where people pursue goals
  they enjoy / find worthwhile.
  * Examples: service, civil rights, religious
* Coercive Organizations: Largely involuntary organizations where people have a
  need to be there.
  * Examples: prison, hospital
* Utilitarian Organization: Organizations people join for a specific purpose.
  They aren't intrinsically enjoyable.
  * Examples: companies, colleges

Often, social organizations become a **bureaucracy**, which is an example of
*rationalization*. Bureaucracies organize individuals to be more efficient and
are large and impersonal and large, but organize individuals.

### Ideal Type Bureaucracy

An **ideal type** bureaucracy is the ideal bureaucracy that satisfies the
following; it would be the "most efficient" social organization/bureaucracy:

* High degree of division of labor: Be more efficient.
* Hierarchy of authority: Be more efficient.
* Rules and regulations: Treat everyone equally.
* Impersonal: Treat everyone equally.
* Career ladders: Encourage people to work.
* Efficiency: Be more efficient.

### Informal Structure of Bureaucracies

However, real bureaucracies are ***never*** ideal type because we're humans and
we can't really be impersonal. This means bureaucracies have an **informal
structure**, which are activities which violate/bypass the formal structure of
the bureaucracy. For example, people preferring their friends or people from a
certain group. This is what we call **corruption**.

### Problems with Bureaucracies

* Ritualism: Excessive following of rules.
* Alienation: When a person is mentally separated from the organization and its
  goals. People feel like they are just "cogs in a machine".
  * Issues: Increased turnover, tardiness, low satisfaction.
* McDonaldization: Basically hyper-rationalization with a focus on the negative
  effects (e.g. impersonal structure).
  * As you could probably guess, this comes from McDonald's and the general
    fast food industry's philosophy being applied to other things.
  * Pros: Cheap, efficient, quick, consistent, wider range of goods to more
    people (cheap), people (normally) treated more equally, culture spreads
    easily.
  * Cons: **Deskilling** (workers are replaceable), impersonality, workers
    (normally) paid worse, consumer workers (e.g. self-checkout), worker
    burnout.
  * Main Dimensions:
    * Efficiency: Always do things the same, efficient way.
    * Calculability: Assess outcomes quantitatively.
    * Predictability: Encourage homogeneity.
    * Control: Replace human labor with more predictable things (e.g. machines)
      wherever possible.
  * Identified by Ritzer.

# Social Networks

* Social Networks: The graph/network of relationships between people, where
  people are nodes and relationships are edges.
* Social Capital: Resources available to people through their network.
  * "Embedded" in social networks.

Society is generally organized as a graph of "bubbles", where the bubbles have
weak ties between then and strong ties within them.

* Weak Ties: People you see / hang out with only occasionally. Very cheap.
* Strong Ties: People you see / hang out with regularly. Very expensive.

For job searching, *weak ties* are more important because they are far more
expansive and often have access to unique information and contacts.

## Network Exclusion

Often, particular groups of people are excluded, either intentionally or
unintentionally. (This is called **nepotism**.) *Why?*

This can be due to intentional/explicit segregation or subconscious bias.
However, most common is people in the network are similar, so they are more
likely to have opportunities for networking (through people wanting to hang
out). Additionally, if people don't already have a connection to a network, it
is difficult to make those initial connections because no one knows you and you
are likely to not have significant things in common, making it harder to make
those connections and network.

Another difficulty is people don't always notice they're being excluded, so
what can they do?

# Conformity

* Conformity: When people do/think things they otherwise wouldn't because of
  group influences.

Generally, people conform to authority and group influences because they either
want to fit in or feel less responsible for their actions because they are in a
group. The responsibility issue is easiest seen with the Kitty Genovese case
and the bystander effect.

Conformity can be both good and bad. We mostly talk about bad thought.

## Milgram Experiment

You should remember this from AP psychology. This is the experiment where the
researcher commanded people to shock an individual. The people could "hear" the
other person being shocked, but they couldn't see them (because they were
recordings). The purpose of the experiment was to see how people will
react/listen to authority. It was inspired by Nazi Germany.

85% of people gave the maximum voltage.

## Asch Conformity Experiment

There was a group of 5 people. Only one person (the final one) was an actual
subject. They had to judge the length of lines. On certain questions, every
confederate would give an incorrect answer vocally and then the subject
answered vocally. Another variation was every confederate except one would give
an incorrect answer vocally and then the subject answered vocally. Another
variation was where every confederate gave an incorrect answer vocally and the
subject answered on paper.

There were two main reasons people changed their answer: conflict avoidance or
affecting their actual beliefs/views.

37% of the people gave the incorrect answer when every confederate gave the
incorrect answer.

5% of the people gave the incorrect answer when every confederate gave the
right answer but one gave the right answer.

## Kitty Genovese / Bystander Effect / Diffusion of Responsibility

You should remember Kitty Genovese from AP psychology. She was murdered and
several people were aware of her being murder, but no one called the police.
This was due to the bystander effect and also a fear of danger, from the
murderer.

The **bystander effect** is the more people that witness an event, the less
responsible each person feels. This means people are less likely to take
action.

## Examples

* Current American immigration camps
* Me Too movement (both before and during)

# Inequality and Stratification

## Causes of Poverty

There are two main arguments for the cause of poverty: cultural and structural.

### Cultural

The **culture of poverty** argument or **blaming the victim** argument
attributes the causes of poverty to the personal work values / irresponsibility
of the poor. Broadly **denounced**.

### Structural

There are multiple parts, but broadly it attributes poverty to the forces in an
economy and society. There are a 3 main parts.

* Economic Restructuring: Recent changes in the economy have made things worse
  for working class.
  * Decline in manufacturing leads to worse jobs (e.g. service jobs)
  * Rise of globalization
* Job Openings: Most newer jobs are low-paying.
* Limited "Opportunity Structure": Not enough "good" or "appropriate" jobs for
  people.

## Stratification

**Stratification** is a fixed, hierarchical arrangement/ranking in society
where people have different access to resources/power/perceived worth.
*Structured inequality.* There are a variety of stratification systems:

* Estate System: Feudalism, where people are bound to owners.
* Caste System: Strict, hierarchical organization, where people are born into
  and bound to a specific caste for life.
* Class System: Less-strict, hierarchical organization, where people can
  potentially change.

**Social class** is the social position of groups relative to the cultural,
economic, and social resources. *Essentially, a group of your life changes*.

We cannot directly measure social class, instead we use some indicators:

* Income
* Occupational Prestige: How much do people respect your job
* Educational Attainment
* Sometimes also occupation and place of residence

**Note:** These do not strictly define class.

**Status attainment** is the process by which people gain a specific position
in a stratification system. **Socioeconomic status (SES)** is commonly how we
describe status, and it includes the above measures.

# Gender and Sexuality

* Gender Socialization: Process by which people learn about the expectations
  and identities for your gender in society.
* Femininities and Masculinities: Traits acquired during gender socialization.
  * It is plural because there are many different forms and traits within a
    society, based off ethnicity, age, social class, etc.
* Homophobia: Negative attitudes towards non-straight people.
  * Homophobia is more prominent in men, as a way to discourage feminine traits
    in men.
* Gender Identity: Person's definition or perception of themselves as a
  particular gender.
* Transgender: People whose gender identity and/or gender presentation differs
  from the gender they were "assigned" at birth due to their sex.
  * May take hormones or surgery to change physical aspects of their physical
    sex.
  * Sometimes has different terms such as genderqueer, agender, and gender
    fluid.
  * Violence against transgender people is very high.
* Intersex: Individuals who are born with both genitalia.
* Sexual Identity: Internal sense of one's sexual self.
* Sexual Orientation: Element of sexual identity referring to who you desire
  (fantasies), who you want to have sexual relations with (behaviors), and who
  you feel connected to (feeling).
  * We tend to simplify hugely. It's not a binary, but a spectrum.
* Sexuality: Capacity to sexual feelings towards certain groups.
  * This tends to be organized as a *continuum*.
* Asexuality: Lack of sexual attraction, desire, etc. Not just low sex drive.
  * Outside of the continuum.
* Heterosexism/Heteronormativity: Belief that heterosexuality is superior to
  other sexual orientations.

In society, gender and sexuality are incredibly linked.

Recall that sociologists discuss the *social construction of gender*, where
they draw a significant difference between sex and gender:

* Sex: Biological male or female. Given by genetics.
  * Biological Determinism: Attributes gender differences to physical
    differences of the sexes.
* Gender: Socially learned expectations, identities, and behaviors associated
  with each sex. A system of social practices that creates the gender
  categories.

## Theories of Gender

### Gender Performance

This theory is similar to the *dramaturgy* theory of social interaction applied
to gender and sexuality.

This was created by **West** and **Zimmerman** in 1987 and onward.They argue
that gender is interaction, a routine and standard of interaction which is
shaped and evaluated by everyday interactions.

Basically, **gender performance** is about **doing gender** and receiving
**recognition** of that gender. When you do gender, you **reproduce** the
existing social order.

### Intersectionality

Intersectionality attempts to look at overlapping/intersecting social
identities and how they create unique specific systems of oppression and
discrimination. Essentially, you can't create overlapping buckets and expect
the overlap to behave the same as the non-overlap.

This was coined by **Kimberle Crenshaw** in 1989.

The biggest example is analyzing the discrimination against women of color. You
can get a more full analysis if you analyze the discrimination of women and the
discrimination of people of color. Then, you synthesize this discrimination to
understand discrimination against women of color.

### Hegemonic Masculinity

*Hegemonic comes from hegemony*.

This was created by R. W. Connell in 1995.

Hegemonic masculinity argues that there is a **hegemonic masculinity** that is
the *ideal vision* of masculinity. This ideal vision of masculinity justifies
the dominant position of men. Many men attempt to achieve hegemonic
masculinity, but are disqualified for some reason. Men who cannot achieve this
instead achieve **subordinate masculinity**. Examples of subordinate
masculinity are gay men or men of color.

Hegemonic masculinity also argues that there is an **emphasized femininity**
that is the *ideal vision* of femininity. It justifies the subordinate position
of women. Likewise, women try to achieve **emphasized femininity**. Women who
don't achieve these ideals are likewise seen as lesser than those who do.

Hegemonic masculinity says that, even if you have subordinate masculinity, you
still benefit from it because of the subordination of women. It also argues
that you can only analyze femininity and masculinity in relation to each other.

# Racial Inequality

Overall, race, ethnicity, and everything **can be changed** and are normally
**defined by the group in power**. In other words, they are **socially
constructed**.

* Race: Distinct group in society based on some biological characteristics.
  * Almost entirely biological.
  * Examples: skin color, lip form, hair texture.
* Ethnicity: Distinct, but not necessarily exclusive, group that is based on
  cultural similarities.
* White: Light skinned people of European descent.
* Whiteness: Construction of white race, white culture, and the system of
  privileges.
  * Early in America: White Anglo Saxon Protestants where white.
  * Now: Any western European (for the most part).
* Prejudice: Beliefs about some group that is unlikely to change based on
  evidence.
  * Includes: racism, stereotyping, scapegoating
* Discrimination: Actions which negatively impact some group. These are
  motivated by prejudices.

## Mass Incarceration

* Mass Incarceration: Process by which people are placed in criminal justice
  system, branded as criminals and felons, locked up for extremely long periods
  of time, and then released and second-class citizens.
  * Began in the 1960s, when we changed from rehabilitation for drug addiction
    to punishment/imprisonment.
    * 1963-1993 incarceration rate increased independent of crime.
  * Marked by President Nixon's **War on Drugs** (1970s).
  * Disproportionately affects **minorities** (especially black) and **men**
    (with the intersection having it the worst).
* Institutional Racism: Racism in the day-to-day operation of social
  institutions/structures, codified in the rules, policies, and practices of
  these institutions.
  * Basically, *routine* and *unequal* treatment.
  * **Worse** than individual racism because its widespread and better at
    prolonging itself.
  * Opioid Epidemic vs War on Drugs: The opioid epidemic is more focused on
    rehabilitation and affects whites more. The war on drugs was more focused
    on imprisonment and affected blacks more.
  * Education System: Black and Latino student bodies receive significantly
    less funding than whites.

Prisoners and felons become **second-class citizens** because they lose the
right to vote, can no longer serve jury duty, and are *legally* discriminated
against in employment and housing.

Mass incarceration *is* a race issue **1.5 million black men** are "missing".

*Michelle Alexander* (2014) argues that mass incarceration is a system of
*racial* and *social* control, which has ushered in the **Negro problem** of
poverty. She argues prisons has been used a "solution" to this problem. She
also argues that **prison privatization** has caused additional issues, where
people profit off of imprisonment of people.

## Colorblind Racism

Bonilla-Silva (2009) attempted to explore the **intent**, **methods**, and
**analysis** for current racial inequality. Basically, he argues that
**colorblindness** is a new form of racism, where people ignore/fail to
acknowledge real racial inequality. This causes people to not address the
actual institutional racism. It also discounts the affect race has on people's
lives.

This is often called the **new Jim-Crow**.

He split his analysis into four main causes for the modern racial inequality.

* **TODO**

# Fighting Inequality

Why don't people resist inequality?

* Current system is legitimized by certain ideologies. For example, equal
  opportunity.
* People don't see realistic alternatives.
* People don't realize that there is inequality.
* People don't realize when they're causing inequality.
* Even if you're resisting inequality successfully, it will take years to see
  any change.
* People are *depoliticized*, meaning they feel powerless to change things and
  essentially give up or stop caring.
* People derive benefits from the inequality.
* Several people are still doing well with the status quo, so they are not
  motivated to change things. *Middle class inertia*.

# Family

## Divorce

* Crude Divorce Rate: Relative to general population.
* Refined Divorce Rate: Relative to unmarried women population.

Crude Divorce Rate
: ![Crude Divorce Rate](crude_divorce_rate.png)

Refined Divorce Rate
: ![Refined Divorce Rate](refined_divorce_rate.png)

**Note:** Several states stopped keeping track of marriage rates from 1998 to
2007.

As you can see, by in large divorce is more common than it used to be because
of

* Legality: No fault divorce laws make it so you don't have to prove a "breach
  of the marriage contract" (e.g. infidelity or abuse).
* Societal Perspective: Divorce is not stigmatized.
* Romantic Love Fades: People often marry when they're just in romantic love.
  * **Companionate love** is not tied to sexual passion and develops more
    gradually.
* Rise of Individualism: People can feasibly live separately.
* Feminism: Women are less economically dependent on men.
* Stress of Marriages: Sharing finances is incredibly difficult, especially
  since women are more independent economically. Children exacerbate this
  because they're expensive.
  * Strongly impacted by the **economy**.

However, the divorce rate has decreased in recent years because of

* Increased cohabitation before marriage, meaning people are more "experienced"
  by the time they marry in general.
* People are waiting longer to get married in general, meaning they are more
  likely to find "the right person" or to be stuck.

# Work & the Economy

## Industrial Revolution

In the 1800s, the industrial revolution occurred. It has the following effects:

* Skilled workers replaced by unskilled workers operating "skilled" machines.
* Longer hours.
* Lower pay because unskilled laborers.
* Workers could be more easily replaced.
* The rise of **unions**.

## Deindustrialization

**Deindustrialization** is the decline in manufacturing and the rise in service
jobs. It was brought about by

* Rise of Automation: Don't need unskilled workers at all anymore.
* Globalization: More developed nations' workers had to compete with less
  developed nations' workers.
* Rise of Consumerism: Cheaper goods led to higher demand.
* Rise of Service Sector

## Dual Labor Market Theory

The market's jobs can be broadly split into two markets:

* Primary Labor Market: High wage jobs with good benefits, good working
  conditions, opportunities for promotion, job protection, and due process.
  * More likely to be unionized and men and majority.
  * Examples: Engineering, law, medicine, executives.
* Secondary Labor Market: Low wage jobs with poor benefits, high turnover, poor
  working conditions, and have little opportunity for advancement.
  * More likely to be women and minorities.
  * Examples: Service, retail, fast food jobs, grocery workers.

## Types of Capitalism

Capitalism is a fuzzy system that has a bunch of different effects and facets.
Competitive capitalism is the ideal, but it leads to monopoly capitalism
because the most competitive firm often purchases the less competitive firm or
the less competitive firm goes out of business (and the less competitive firm's
workers and customer often head to the more competitive firm).

* Competitive Capitalism: Large number of small firms. No firm dominates.
* Monopoly Capitalism: One or a few (oligopoly) huge cooperations dominate
  certain markets (can be one or many markets).

## Applications to the United States

C. Wright Mill' **power elite theory** says there there exists a power elite
that controls a large amount of wealth, privilege, and political power. This
power stretches across institutions: government, military, and economy. They
are largely unified on their desire to maintain power, although they have some
disagreements.

## Occupational Sex Segregation

This is a bit of gender and a bit of economy. **Occupational sex segregation**
is where, in the same job, there are differences in how men and women are
treated. There's a few explanations for this:

* Neoclassical Explanation: Sex segregation in the workplace suggests men and
  women allocate different amount of effort between *workplace* and the
  *household*. Basically, says women put more effort into family.
  * Shown to not hold in recent years. It's not the "effort" but more the
    traits associated with the job (i.e. some jobs are "manly" and some are
    "womanly").
* Women Sustain Disadvantage in the Workplace: Traditional ideologies are
  upheld in the workplace by employers ranking prospective employees on their
  potential productivity and their characteristics. Women are seen to be more
  likely to quit / be less productive because of children. Also, since most of
  these jobs are already male-dominated, the employers and current employees
  are more likely to highly rate men, since they are in their *ingroup*. This
  is an example of the *old boys network*.

One of the biggest effects of occupational sex segregation is in terms of pay
and the **gender wage gap**. The pay gap comes from women generally being in
lower paying jobs and women being paid less within the same job. Interestingly,
previously female dominated jobs tend to be higher paid when they become male
dominated.

This has led to the **devaluation hypothesis** which says that female dominated
jobs are paid less because society devalues women's labor.

There's also the **glass ceiling** for women, which describes how women who
enter male dominated fields tend to eventually hit a "ceiling" in their promotion,
where they eventually are no longer promoted. There's also the **glass
escalator** for men, which describes how men who enter female dominated fields
tend to be more readily promoted into management.

Theres a concept of **emotional labor**, which is the management of your
feelings and emotions for job. This puts a lot of stress on the individual and
increases rate of depression and mental illness. Service and secondary labor
market labor tends to be more emotional labor heavy. Women tend to have more
service jobs, meaning they have a higher rate of depression and mental illness
because of their jobs.

# Education

* Meritocracy: System based on the ideology that all people have an equal
  chance of succeeding with hard work.
  * **Requires** people's background to be unrelated to mobility.
  * Idea: People succeed based off their own **merit**.
* Tracking / Curriculum Differentiation: Separating students within schools
  according to some measure of ability.
  * Issues:
    * Lack of standardization.
    * Non-standardized tracking policies.
    * Race and class affect student placement.
    * Lack of mobility across tracks. (Working class students are often tracked
      into vocational education.)
    * Subjective / non-objective measures can be used (e.g. parents just
      asking).
  * This worsens educational inequality and segregation.
  * Basically, AG, AP, NCSSM, and the like.
* Districting / Redlining: The process of explicitly or implicitly districting
  schools along race and income lines.
  * Worsens educational inequality especially by race and income.
* Stereotype Threat: Individual has stress/fear of confirming negative
  stereotypes about their race / gender.

America strives to be a *meritocracy*. However, it is unequal with the
following failures

* Students with highest reading and math scores at end of high school are
  parents who have most education.
* Asians and Whites are more likely than Blacks and Latinos to complete high
  school and attain higher education.
* Women have better high school completion rates and are more likely to attain
  higher education.

## Coleman Report

James Coleman (1966) estimated how much schools differ in equality and found
that achievement was most related to *teacher quality*, *family background*,
and *racial composition*. He found that black children in integrated schools
did better than those in non-integrated schools.

Coleman's report was against school redlining or segregation.

## Gender in Education

Women are more likely to be more educated. However, they receive less rewards.
*What gives?*

* Differential Reference Groups: Women compare themselves to other women,
  seeing that women can do well with high education.
* Pollyanna Hypothesis: Women see gender inequality to be thing of past, so who
  gives a shit.
* Social Powerlessness: Women go to college to get a rich man.
* Sex-Role Socialization: Women tend to believe that their abilities are innate
  and unchangeable, but men tend to believe that can develop or improve their
  abilities with practice and effort. This
  * The evidence for this is that girls with higher IQ tend to give up more
    quickly than those with a low IQ.

# Lareau (2011) - Unequal Childhoods

In most cases of child care, social class trumps race, since race is something
other people interpret while social class is something you feel.

## Parenting

You can sum up the difference in that broadly poor parents see their children
as kids to provide for while rich parents see their children as growing adults
to nurture. To use her terms:

* Concerted Cultivation: The process by which middle class parents raise their
  children to interact with and question adults through many diverse, organized
  activities. Organized leisure activities controlled by parents to help a
  child develop.
* Accomplishment of Natural Growth: The process by which poor parents raise
  their children by providing their necessities and making sure they are
  healthy and alive. Generally, they stay out of the child's social and
  emotional life; believing that it will unfold naturally.

Although this divide makes rich/middle-class parents sound strictly better,
there are economic differences. Middle class parents don't have to worry about
food, basic medicine, or how to keep your child healthy and alive as much.

Concerted cultivation tends to better prepare children for being adults but is
more stressful.

Accomplishment of natural growth tends to lead to more relaxed children who are
more capable of creating activities by themselves. The nature of poor parents
also tends to make the children less trusting of and more apprehensive around
authority.

This does cause issues though because schools encourage concerted cultivation,
which causes dissonance or something for poor kids.

Our **dominant set of cultural repertoires** (or the way we think about
something) for children tends to be that it is best to treat them like adults
and to reason with them, but these change all the time. Rich parents also tend
to change more quickly. Since rich parents adopt more quickly, they tend to be
more in-line with the common body of education thought (i.e. schools). This
gives the children and parents an advantage of being considered "better" by the
school.

## Children

Rich children tend to have a **sense of entitlement**, where they believe that
they deserve to manage their own time and have their opinions be heard. They
tend to be better at expressing their wishes and manipulating adults to give
them what they want. They tend to be worse about organizing their time and
being considered subordinate to adults.

Poor children tend to have a **sense of constrain**, where they are unlikely to
make special requests, tend to not resist authority figures (as much), and tend
to disregard rules (e.g. encouraging/being proud of your kid "beating up"
another kid).

Poor children tend to see their parents fail to change institutions / have them
listen, while rich children tend to see their parents succeed.

# Rank (2011) - Rethinking American Poverty

Generally, America has viewed poverty as a personal failure. This means we
broadly don't feel socially obligated to help them. This is seen by our lack of
sympathy for working-age poor, but large(r) sympathy for old poor.

This refusal of reality allows us to reinforce our ideals: individualism and
self-reliance, hard work pays off, and there are economic opportunities for
all. This has also led to hyper-competitiveness, as people try to "improve" the
system by just making everyone better. However, the real problem is lack of
opportunity.

Additionally, things have been getting worse. Jobs are not as stable, health
care benefits are worse, wages are stagnated, and many social welfare programs
are being cut.

## Necessary Changes to Solve Poverty

* Recognize that **poverty** indirectly **affects everyone** in society.
  * Poverty has a steep price (e.g. emergency room visits rather than yearly
    checkups, social programs, higher rate of doing crime)
  * Many Americans will experience poverty at some point (e.g. 66% on social
    welfare at some point, 60% in poverty for a year)
  * "Out of sight, out of mind" oftentimes with inner city or rural.
  * It's been getting worse.
* Realize that the existence of poverty is a **structural** issue.
  * Caused by our economics and politics.
  * While there may be individual reasons for poverty (e.g. lack of education),
    these can also be structural issues. Also, this doesn't explain lack of
    opportunity in the first place. (That is, why do people have to lose?)
  * Economy has been producing more low-paying, part time, and no-benefits
    jobs.
    * 33% of jobs pay less than \$11.50
  * Think of musical chairs analogy. Sure, the losers may have reasons for
    being slower (i.e. old or disabled), but why don't we have enough chairs?
* Taking a more **proactive approach towards preventing poverty**, by viewing
  it as a moral injustice. This would prevent / make more abuses more
  difficult.
  * Examples of Abuses: burnout, pay cuts, reduction in benefits
  * In 1980, a CEO was paid 42 times that of an average worker. Now, it is 400
    times.

## Stats

* 50% of children will be on food stamps at some point in childhood.
* Bottom 60% hold less than 1% of wealth.
* 66% of counties where black children are growing up and considered high
  poverty.

# Rist (1970)

* Goal: Understand how schools reproduce the class structure and divisions of
  society.
* Methods: Longitudinal observational study. She started observing children in
  kindergarten. She went through to at least 2nd grade.

Her takeaways in kindergarten were that the teacher divided the class into
three tables. Table 1, table 2, and table 3, with the following behaviors.

* Table 1:
  * "Fast learners".
  * 0 smelled like urine.
  * More likely to be middle / upper class.
  * Had middle class cultural capital, like the teacher.
  * Learn directly from the teacher through her direct interactions with you.
  * Generally felt superior to table 2 and 3. Made fun of table 2 and 3.
* Table 2:
  * "Slow learners".
  * 2 smelled like urine.
  * Learn through watching the teacher interact with table 1.
* Table 3:
  * "Slow learners".
  * 5 smelled like urine.
  * Learn through watching the teacher interact with table 1.

For 1st and 2nd grade, the same division occurred, where students were unlikely
to change their group. In 1st grade, these tables became tables A, B, and C
respectively. In 2nd grade, these tables became the Tigers, Cardinals, and
Clowns.
