For fun during quarantine I decided to go through my collection of travel-size
toothpaste tubes to figure out which one is the best. This was back in late
March, early April mind you. I was pretty bored with weeks of quarantine and
definitely not adjusted to all the changes, so this was like a fun little game
for myself I did. I kept individual notes on all the different toothpastes and
ranked them individually.

When I told this to one of my friends they thought it was interesting and
encouraged me to make it my first blog post. I think it's a cute enough idea
and I've been wanting to start actually making some posts on my blog since I
have a few draft posts around. Sadly I didn't think to take pictures of the
toothpaste tubes as I was doing the reviews and I can't bring myself to take
images from online at the risk of this seeming even remotely legitimate. I also
don't include prices or links because I can't be bothered. Anyway, let's get
into the ranking.

# 1. Crest Complete with Scope

Somewhat unsurprisingly, this is the toothpaste that I normally use, so
obviously I'd like it. Compared to #2 (Crest Gum Detoxify), it has a slightly
worse flavor and foaminess. But at a significant fraction of the price you
still get a good-flavored paste that strikes a good balance between foam
and paste.

# 2. Crest Gum Detoxify

At the price, you'd expect this toothpaste to be excellent, and you'd be right.
It had the best texture and taste of any of the toothpastes I used and
definitely left my mouth feeling the cleanest. It's just so expensive that I
can't put it at first.

# 3. Colgate Clean Mint

This one reminded me a lot of #5 (Crest Cavity Protection Regular Paste) but
better across the board. It tasted slightly stronger than it and had a
noticeably more pleasant texture. Otherwise it's a pretty unremarkable
toothpaste.

# 4. Listerine Essential Care Gel

This toothpaste (well, toothgel I guess?) surprised me the most of all the
toothpastes I reviewed. It doesn't spread very well because it's a gel but the
taste is incredibly pleasant and feels very clean. The taste is somewhere
between Listerine mouthwash and regular crest toothpaste, leaving a very clean
feel in your mouth. Also, once you get used to the gel aspect it actually
spreads incredibly well, although it doesn't foam up as much as I prefer.

# 5. Crest Cavity Protection Regular Paste

Maybe it's because this is what I grew up with but this is exactly what comes
to my mind when I think of toothpaste. It has a fairly weak mint flavor but is
very agreeable. It spreads nicely and foams up pretty well. Yeah, it's what a
toothpaste should do at a good price. I personally consider this the floor of
good toothpastes.

# 6. Aquafresh Extreme Clean

Oh Aquafresh, I never used you before now and I'm glad. This was the hardest
paste to spread (much worse than the gel above!) and hardly foamed at all once
you actually got it all over your teeth. The taste was the harshest mint I
tried and didn't even leave your mouth feeling clean. It wasn't actively
unpleasant to use but there are so many better options.

# 7. Crest 3D White

As a rule, I think whitening toothpastes and other products are a bad idea.
Teeth aren't naturally perfectly white and there's no long term benefits to
whitening them (that I know of). So whitening teeth is just superficial,
expensive, and painful to me.

Crest 3D White toothpaste did nothing to change this for me. Every night
brushing my teeth felt like punishment where I'd use a toothpaste that tasted,
spread, and foamed like silt, leaving a somewhat dirty feeling in my mouth.
Also, whenever I used it my teeth would burn a little. From talking to friends
I think this is normal for whitening products, but I still don't want brushing
my teeth to hurt. It was a bearable experience but made me not look forward to
brushing my teeth even if they felt gross.

# 8. Kid's Crest Cavity Protection Sparkle Fun

Oh. My. God. This toothpaste was awful. I used it a few times as a kid during
family vacations and the like, and I do not remember this toothpaste being So
unpleasant. It foamed up so much and felt vaguely gritty I think from the
glitter. The worst was the taste. All the others tasted like mint, which is
what I've come to expect from a toothpaste. However, in an attempt to appeal to
kids, this one tastes like bubblegum. I don't know whose idea it was to use a
sugary food as a flavor for toothpaste but whenever I used this not only did it
taste bad it also left a very dirty taste in my mouth, like I just ate candy.
Using it as an adult was an awful experience, but from what I remember as a kid
I actually liked it so maybe they're just hitting their target audience really
well.

# Raw Notes

Here is a literal transcription of my original notes from my phone.

1. Crest Complete with Scope: A slightly worse Crest Gum Detoxify at a fraction
   of the price. My personal favorite.
1. Crest Gum Detoxify: Pleasantly smooth and minty. Most expensive I tried but
   also best toothpaste I've ever used.
1. Colgate Clean Mint: Slightly stronger mint than Crest's regular paste makes
   it slightly more pleasant. But otherwise unremarkable.
1. Listerine Essential Care Gel: Doesn't spread very well because it's a gel.
   Taste is shockingly pleasant, somewhere between Listerine mouthwash and
   regular crest toothpaste. Leaves a very clean feel in your mouth.
1. Crest Cavity Protection Regular Paste: Unremarkable and reasonably priced.
1. Aquafresh Extreme Clean: Harsh taste and paste that doesn't spread or foam
   very well. Not unpleasant but took some getting used to.
1. Crest 3D White: Tastes like clay and one of the more expensive toothpastes.
   Weird texture and vaguely burns after use. Unpleasant to use but bearable.
   Also teeth whitening is unnecessary IMO.
1. Kid's Crest Cavity Protection Sparkle Fun: Foams up an absurd amount,
   vaguely gritty, tastes like awful bubble gum. Using it was an awful
   experience.
