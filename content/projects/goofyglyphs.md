# Structure

Every clause in the emoji language follows the strict "Subject - Verb -
Object/Destination" structure. Each part must be one emoji and all must be
present for clause to be complete. Within a message, the same emoji refers to
the same object/event; use identifiers to have multiple similar objects/events.

*Example:* I know you = "👈🧠👉".

You can also have exclamations, which are just a single emoji indicating the
exclamation.

*Example:* It's raining = "🌧️".

## Emoji Descriptors

Every emoji can have a description phrase associated with it. These phrases are
placed after the emoji they describe and start with a single, special emoji
indicating what kind descriptor it is.

* ▶ (... ◀): Adjective phrase. This phrase contains a list of
  adjective-type emojis, followed by a ◀ to indicate the end of the adjective
  phrase. If you only have one adjective-type emoji, ◀ does not need to be
  specified.
  * *Example:* My dog ate a big round chicken = "🐕▶👈🍴🐔▶🆙⚪◀".
* ⏩: Descriptive clause. Begins a new subject-verb-object clause which
  specifically describes the affected emoji.
  * *Example:* The dog, which I bought, makes me happy = "🐕⏩👈💳🐕😊👈"
* 🚫: Negator. Negates emoji immediately following. This does not have any
  emojis in its descriptor phrase. "Not".
* 0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣6️⃣7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣🔟: Identifiers. Since emojis tend to refer to the same
  object/event, you can use identifiers to differentiate between similar
  objects/events.

## The Substantive Emoji

The 🔼 emoji introduces a new subject-verb-object clause which itself acts where
the 🔼 is placed.
* *Example:* I wonder if fish swim like to sailboats (I'm thinking about whether
  fish swim similarly to boats) = "👈🤔🔼🏊▶🐟↔️❓🏊▶⛵"

## Verb Modifiers

Verbs in particular can have modifiers. These modifiers are placed after the
verb they affect, just like emoji descriptors.

* ❓: Interrogator. Marks the verb-clause as a true-false question.
  * *Example:* "👉"
* Tense Modifiers: These indicate the tense of the verb. If unspecified, then
  verbs are roughly present tense.
  * 🕘: Past. Something which did occur and has now finished.
    * *Example:* I used to want a meal = "👈🙏🕘🍽️"
  * 🕛: Present. Something which recently began occurring and is still occurring
    and will continue occurring.
    * *Example:* I currently want a meal = "👈🙏🕛🍽️"
  * 🕒: Future. Something which has not yet occurred but will later.
    * *Example:* I will want a meal = "👈🙏🕒🍽️"

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions introduce new subject-verb-object clauses with a specific relation
to the previous one.

* ➕: Additional. The following clause exists in addition to the previous one.
  "And" or "But".
* ➖: Optional. Either the following clause or the preceding clause are true,
  but not both. "Or" or "Either... Or".
* ✖️: Causal. The following clause caused or motivated the earlier clause.
  "Because" or "Since".
* ➗: Concessional. The following clause occurred in spite of the earlier one,
  explaining a reason the earlier one shouldn't have happened, can not follow a
  descriptive clause. "Although".

# Vocabulary

## Pronouns

* 👈: 1st person.
