What makes your research unique.</ul><p>Sociologists generally don't replicate a study unless a previous research study had questionable practices. (This is rationalized because of peer review) If there is replication, there tends to be a "twist" and researches themselves will recommend twists.<p>Sociological research tends to be split between quantitative and qualitative. Here's a broad overview:<ul><li>Quantitative:<ul><li>Deductive (theory/hypotheses to research)<li>Methods: surveys, polls, structured questionnaires, experiments (i.e. numerical data)<li>Asks: relate, effect, cause, impact<li>Broad<li>Generalizable</ul><li>Qualitative:<ul><li>Inductive (research to theory/hypotheses)<li>Methods: participant observation, focus groups, in-depth interviews (i.e. text-based data)<li>Asks "what" or "how"<li>Deep<li>Not generalizable</ul></ul><p>It is important to note that sociological research tends to have values that can impact their research (see <strong>positionality</strong>). This positionality is more impactful for qualitative research.<p>To try to combat positionality, sociologists (especially qualitative) tend to be very reflective, describing their position and history and how that may impact their research.<h2 id=quantitative-research><a href=#quantitative-research aria-label="anchor link for quantitative-research">##</a> Quantitative Research</h2><p>Quantitative research seeks to create associations/correlations and uses hypotheses. Actual numbers and counts (of groups) are used; numbers are often hard to get, so we can be pretty liberal.<p>To show causality, sociologists only must only show the following to a reasonable person.<ul><li>Correlation: We need to see them together.<li>Temporal Ordering: We need to know that our independent variable occurs before our dependent variable.<li>Non-Spuriousness: The relationship makes sense / isn't caused by anything else.</ul><p>As you can see, sociologists are pretty liberal. Their requirements are sound in theory, but it's hard to prove non-spuriousness in practice without experiments, which we can't (normally) do because of ethics.<p>Quantitative research normally uses surveys, polls, structured questionnaires, experiments (i.e., numerical data).<p>Quantitative research tends to be easy to generalize.<h3 id=examples><a href=#examples aria-label="anchor link for examples">###</a> Examples</h3><p>Does critical thinking ability relate to student achievement?<p>Is there a relationship between neighborhood type (e.g. residential, business district) and types of crimes committed (e.g. car theft, robbery)?<h2 id=qualitative-research><a href=#qualitative-research aria-label="anchor link for qualitative-research">##</a> Qualitative Research</h2><p>Qualitative research seeks to understand individual people's <em>perceptions</em> of their <em>experiences</em>, what <em>meaning</em> people attribute to themselves, and the <em>social processes</em> that help form their lives.<p>There are no hypotheses and it is very individual and touchy-feely. It's a lot like case-studies except normal.<p>Qualitative research tends to be very exploratory, where people start with a central question that spawns sub-questions.<p>Normally works with <strong>symbolic interaction</strong> on the <strong>micro level</strong>.<p>Qualitative research normally uses participant observation, focus groups, in-depth interviews (i.e. text-based data)<p>Qualitative research tends to be hard to generalize.<h3 id=examples-1><a href=#examples-1 aria-label="anchor link for examples-1">###</a> Examples</h3><p>What are the experiences of minority students in predominantly white educational institutions?<p>How do parents discuss sex and sexuality with early adolescent girls and boys?<h2 id=themes><a href=#themes aria-label="anchor link for themes">##</a> Themes</h2><ul><li>(Social) Diversity: The variety of group experiences that come from social structure.<ul><li>Group differences in opportunities<li>Shaping of social institutions by various factors.</ul><li>(Social) Inequality: Ways social categories are differentially positioned with social goods (e.g. labor market, education, healthcare, political representation, etc.)<li>Globalization: Increased economic, political, and social connectedness and interdependence among societies around the world.<ul><li>Pros: More access to goods and services, shared technology, etc.<li>Cons: Job displacement, pollution impacts, "deviant globalization" (terrorism, sex trafficking, black market, etc.)<li>Causes: Internet, container ships, airplanes.</ul></ul><h2 id=levels-of-study><a href=#levels-of-study aria-label="anchor link for levels-of-study">##</a> "Levels" of Study</h2><ul><li>Personal Level (micro): Studying individual people<ul><li>Examples: symbolic interaction, family conflict, aging</ul><li>Societal Level (macro): Examine whole semi-homogeneous group.<ul><li>Examples: crime and law, poverty and wealth, social movements</ul><li>Global Level (macro): Examine whole world.<ul><li>Examples: war and peace, global economy<li>Increasingly similar to societal level.</ul></ul><h2 id=ethics><a href=#ethics aria-label="anchor link for ethics">##</a> Ethics</h2><p>Here are some examples of ethical controversies:<ul><li>Philip Zimbardo: Stanford Prison Experiment (1971)<ul><li>Issue: Students did not have <strong>informed consent</strong>.

There are examples of societies that have different social constructions or it is comprehensible that there exists a society with different social constructions.<p>How do we get these? Media, family, history, agriculture(!), etc.<p>Sociologists consider (our perception of) reality a social construction (i.e. <strong>social construction of reality theory</strong>) because we learn and comprehend a lot about reality via language and communication, which is a social construction. This is just a <strong>HOT</strong> way to say that you get biases from your culture/upbringing/society that you hold to be fundamental truths being constantly reaffirmed due to confirmation bias and self-fulfilling prophecies. (There is no reality! Hahaha.)<p>The concept of a <strong>shared social reality</strong> is said to be the commonly held social constructions in a group that helps form the basis of a society and hold them together.<h3 id=examples-2><a href=#examples-2 aria-label="anchor link for examples-2">###</a> Examples</h3><p>A poorer, more crime-heavy neighborhood gets randomly frisked and high levels of police surveillance.

Lifelong process of learning the expectations, values, norms, and roles of a culture. How an individual learns their "place" in society.</ul><p>Socialization is split into childhood / <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>adult</strong> socialization.<p>Primary socialization is how newborns and young children acquire language, identities, and culture (routines, norms, and values). This is chiefly responsible for transforming children into prepared adults (called <strong>anticipatory socialization</strong>). Parents and the family unit are responsible for this.<p>For the longest time, primary socialization was assumed to be one-direction, from parent to child. Recent research shows that this is two-directional. This is most easily seen by children of immigrants teaching and exposing their parents to the language and culture of their new home. Additionally with technology. This backflow is called <strong>reverse socialization</strong>.<p>Adult socialization occurs with peers (and also children). Generally, this is people slowly evolving in a changing society. The most common change is changing your "presentation of self". Adult socialization can also occur with <strong>resocialization</strong>, where people have to <em>unlearn</em> their old behaviors, norms, and culture and learn new ones. This occurs most in <strong>total institutions</strong>, which are closed off enclaves of culture (e.g. military and prison).<h2 id=nature-vs-nurture><a href=#nature-vs-nurture aria-label="anchor link for nature-vs-nurture">##</a> Nature vs Nurture</h2><p>Sociologists tend to believe nurture plays a very large role.

There are noticeable class and racial differences.<li>Schools: Teachers have implicit biases and beliefs that their students are exposed to ("hidden curriculum"). Gender roles become more extreme here due to exposure to other people in the same age and the "hidden curriculum" (e.g. boys line up here, girls play with these toys, etc.).<li>Peers: Your peers beliefs amplify and affect your beliefs.

Any extreme, far-leaning political or religious groups can be categorized as subcultures. Some examples are Amish, LGTBQ+, and polyamorists. <strong>Counter-culture</strong> is similar to subculture except their culture tends to actively and vocally reject mainstream cultures and they can often impact/change mainstream culture.

There's a few explanations for this:<ul><li>Neoclassical Explanation: Sex segregation in the workplace suggests men and women allocate different amount of effort between <em>workplace</em> and the <em>household</em>. Basically, says women put more effort into family.<ul><li>Shown to not hold in recent years. It's not the "effort" but more the traits associated with the job (i.e. some jobs are "manly" and some are "womanly").</ul><li>Women Sustain Disadvantage in the Workplace: Traditional ideologies are upheld in the workplace by employers ranking prospective employees on their potential productivity and their characteristics. Women are seen to be more likely to quit / be less productive because of children. Also, since most of these jobs are already male-dominated, the employers and current employees are more likely to highly rate men, since they are in their <em>ingroup</em>. This is an example of the <em>old boys network</em>.</ul><p>One of the biggest effects of occupational sex segregation is in terms of pay and the <strong>gender wage gap</strong>. The pay gap comes from women generally being in lower paying jobs and women being paid less within the same job. Interestingly, previously female dominated jobs tend to be higher paid when they become male dominated.<p>This has led to the <strong>devaluation hypothesis</strong> which says that female dominated jobs are paid less because society devalues women's labor.<p>There's also the <strong>glass ceiling</strong> for women, which describes how women who enter male dominated fields tend to eventually hit a "ceiling" in their promotion, where they eventually are no longer promoted. There's also the <strong>glass escalator</strong> for men, which describes how men who enter female dominated fields tend to be more readily promoted into management.<p>Theres a concept of <strong>emotional labor</strong>, which is the management of your feelings and emotions for job. This puts a lot of stress on the individual and increases rate of depression and mental illness. Service and secondary labor market labor tends to be more emotional labor heavy.

To use her terms:<ul><li>Concerted Cultivation: The process by which middle class parents raise their children to interact with and question adults through many diverse, organized activities. Organized leisure activities controlled by parents to help a child develop.<li>Accomplishment of Natural Growth: The process by which poor parents raise their children by providing their necessities and making sure they are healthy and alive. Generally, they stay out of the child's social and emotional life; believing that it will unfold naturally.</ul><p>Although this divide makes rich/middle-class parents sound strictly better, there are economic differences. Middle class parents don't have to worry about food, basic medicine, or how to keep your child healthy and alive as much.<p>Concerted cultivation tends to better prepare children for being adults but is more stressful.<p>Accomplishment of natural growth tends to lead to more relaxed children who are more capable of creating activities by themselves. The nature of poor parents also tends to make the children less trusting of and more apprehensive around authority.<p>This does cause issues though because schools encourage concerted cultivation, which causes dissonance or something for poor kids.<p>Our <strong>dominant set of cultural repertoires</strong> (or the way we think about something) for children tends to be that it is best to treat them like adults and to reason with them, but these change all the time. Rich parents also tend to change more quickly. Since rich parents adopt more quickly, they tend to be more in-line with the common body of education thought (i.e. schools). This gives the children and parents an advantage of being considered "better" by the school.<h2 id=children><a href=#children aria-label="anchor link for children">##</a> Children</h2><p>Rich children tend to have a <strong>sense of entitlement</strong>, where they believe that they deserve to manage their own time and have their opinions be heard. They tend to be better at expressing their wishes and manipulating adults to give them what they want. They tend to be worse about organizing their time and being considered subordinate to adults.<p>Poor children tend to have a <strong>sense of constrain</strong>, where they are unlikely to make special requests, tend to not resist authority figures (as much), and tend to disregard rules (e.g. encouraging/being proud of your kid "beating up" another kid).<p>Poor children tend to see their parents fail to change institutions / have them listen, while rich children tend to see their parents succeed.<h1 id=rank-2011-rethinking-american-poverty><a href=#rank-2011-rethinking-american-poverty aria-label="anchor link for rank-2011-rethinking-american-poverty">#</a> Rank (2011) - Rethinking American Poverty</h1><p>Generally, America has viewed poverty as a personal failure. This means we broadly don't feel socially obligated to help them. This is seen by our lack of sympathy for working-age poor, but large(r) sympathy for old poor.<p>This refusal of reality allows us to reinforce our ideals: individualism and self-reliance, hard work pays off, and there are economic opportunities for all. This has also led to hyper-competitiveness, as people try to "improve" the system by just making everyone better. However, the real problem is lack of opportunity.<p>Additionally, things have been getting worse. Jobs are not as stable, health care benefits are worse, wages are stagnated, and many social welfare programs are being cut.<h2 id=necessary-changes-to-solve-poverty><a href=#necessary-changes-to-solve-poverty aria-label="anchor link for necessary-changes-to-solve-poverty">##</a> Necessary Changes to Solve Poverty</h2><ul><li>Recognize that <strong>poverty</strong> indirectly <strong>affects everyone</strong> in society.<ul><li>Poverty has a steep price (e.g. emergency room visits rather than yearly checkups, social programs, higher rate of doing crime)<li>Many Americans will experience poverty at some point (e.g. 66% on social welfare at some point, 60% in poverty for a year)<li>"Out of sight, out of mind" oftentimes with inner city or rural.<li>It's been getting worse.</ul><li>Realize that the existence of poverty is a <strong>structural</strong> issue.<ul><li>Caused by our economics and politics.<li>While there may be individual reasons for poverty (e.g. lack of education), these can also be structural issues.
