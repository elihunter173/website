Unit tests are small and automated. Acceptance tests test the whole system so you compare against the requirements. They are often complex enough that they're difficult or not worth it to automate, but that's not always the case.<p>It is beneficial to draft your test plan when you're doing your requirements.<p>Make sure your acceptance test plan is <em>specific</em>, you should fully describe everything and make it so it's impossible for someone to reasonably do something other than you intend. Make sure you create a test data set for your acceptance tests to use. Your test data should be (relatively) small and understandable.<p>In OPR 1 we should report on test plan, test design.</article>
