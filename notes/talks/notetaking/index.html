Instead, we're talking about notes for creating things and improving creativity.<p>The big picture is thinking about notetaking; the habits which inform the use of our notes; and the principles which inform our structure.<p>Here are names and misc things mentioned.<ul><li>Tiago Forte's "Second Brain": System for taking notes.<li>Zettelkasten: Inspiration for Tiago Forte's "Second Brain". This was a physical system of notecards and links with notecards.<ul><li>Andy Matuschak: English source for Zettelkasten.<li>SÃ¶nke Ahrens: Another writer.</ul><li>Notational Velocity: Note taking app.<li>Atom Notes: Notational velocity for Atom.<li>Vim Notes: <a href=https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim>https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim</a></ul><h1 id=thinking-about-notetaking>Thinking About Notetaking</h1><p>Think of brain as data structure where ...<ul><li>Input: Reading, lectures.<li>Preprocessing: Note system.<li>Queries: Recall.<li>Application: Make something.</ul><p>Think of yourself as three selfs: past self, current self, and future self.<p>You should think of future self in two ways: as a stranger and as yourself. As a stranger, you want to build the tools and take the notes to help a future you which has forgotten things. As yourself, you want to help yourself.<p><em>Aside: I enjoy writing notes like I'm talking to someone else because of this.</em><p>You can waste time even if you're doing something productive. For example, if you read something incredibly deep or learn a lot but don't take any notes. When you later forget that, your past self wasted your current self's time.<h1 id=habits>Habits</h1><ul><li>Atomic Notes: Every note should be small, focused, and standalone.<li>Start from Abundance: Takes lots of notes. Don't try to do a "heavy lift" where you do all the work at once. If you take lots of small notes, you can slowly build up to something large.<li>CODE: (From Tiago Forte)<ul><li>C: Capture / Collect good ideas.<li>O: Organize information. We'll emphasize <em>links</em> of information.<li>D: Distill ideas. Think of as refactoring.<li>E: Express. Make stuff.</ul><li>Play: Get comfortable exploring your notes and "having conversations with your past self".</ul><h1 id=principles>Principles</h1><ul><li>Text files<li>Full text search<li>Easy to make and follow links<li>Fast note creation</ul><p>A good bonus is having executable code.</article>
