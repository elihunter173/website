Each part must be one emoji and all must be present for clause to be complete. Within a message, the same emoji refers to the same object/event; use identifiers to have multiple similar objects/events.<p><em>Example:</em> I know you = "👈🧠👉".<p>You can also have exclamations, which are just a single emoji indicating the exclamation.<p><em>Example:</em> It's raining = "🌧️".<h2 id=emoji-descriptors>Emoji Descriptors</h2><p>Every emoji can have a description phrase associated with it. These phrases are placed after the emoji they describe and start with a single, special emoji indicating what kind descriptor it is.<ul><li>▶ (... ◀): Adjective phrase. This phrase contains a list of adjective-type emojis, followed by a ◀ to indicate the end of the adjective phrase. If you only have one adjective-type emoji, ◀ does not need to be specified.<ul><li><em>Example:</em> My dog ate a big round chicken = "🐕▶👈🍴🐔▶🆙⚪◀".</ul><li>⏩: Descriptive clause. Begins a new subject-verb-object clause which specifically describes the affected emoji.<ul><li><em>Example:</em> The dog, which I bought, makes me happy = "🐕⏩👈💳🐕😊👈"</ul><li>🚫: Negator. Negates emoji immediately following. This does not have any emojis in its descriptor phrase. "Not".<li>0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣6️⃣7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣🔟: Identifiers. Since emojis tend to refer to the same object/event, you can use identifiers to differentiate between similar objects/events.</ul><h2 id=the-substantive-emoji>The Substantive Emoji</h2><p>The 🔼 emoji introduces a new subject-verb-object clause which itself acts where the 🔼 is placed.<ul><li><em>Example:</em> I wonder if fish swim like to sailboats (I'm thinking about whether fish swim similarly to boats) = "👈🤔🔼🏊▶🐟↔️❓🏊▶⛵"</ul><h2 id=verb-modifiers>Verb Modifiers</h2><p>Verbs in particular can have modifiers. These modifiers are placed after the verb they affect, just like emoji descriptors.<ul><li>❓: Interrogator. Marks the verb-clause as a true-false question.<ul><li><em>Example:</em> "👉"</ul><li>Tense Modifiers: These indicate the tense of the verb. If unspecified, then verbs are roughly present tense.<ul><li>🕘: Past. Something which did occur and has now finished.<ul><li><em>Example:</em> I used to want a meal = "👈🙏🕘🍽️"</ul><li>🕛: Present. Something which recently began occurring and is still occurring and will continue occurring.<ul><li><em>Example:</em> I currently want a meal = "👈🙏🕛🍽️"</ul><li>🕒: Future. Something which has not yet occurred but will later.<ul><li><em>Example:</em> I will want a meal = "👈🙏🕒🍽️"</ul></ul></ul><h2 id=conjunctions>Conjunctions</h2><p>Conjunctions introduce new subject-verb-object clauses with a specific relation to the previous one.<ul><li>➕: Additional. The following clause exists in addition to the previous one. "And" or "But".<li>➖: Optional. Either the following clause or the preceding clause are true, but not both. "Or" or "Either... Or".<li>✖️: Causal. The following clause caused or motivated the earlier clause. "Because" or "Since".<li>➗: Concessional. The following clause occurred in spite of the earlier one, explaining a reason the earlier one shouldn't have happened, can not follow a descriptive clause. "Although".</ul><h1 id=vocabulary>Vocabulary</h1><h2 id=pronouns>Pronouns</h2><ul><li>👈: 1st person.<li>👉: 2nd person.<li>👐: 3rd person.<li>👇: Demonstrative pronoun (often followed by a descriptive clause), essentially can be used like a placeholder for a noun. This is essentially an unspecified object/event.</ul><h2 id=common-vocabulary>Common Vocabulary</h2><ul><li>➡️: to be.<li>🙏: to want/need/hope for; prayer.<li>✊: to own/have; fist.<li>✴️: to happen/occur; explosion.<li>🗣️: to say/write/communicate; speaking/speech.<li>🧠: to know/remember; knowledge/memory.</ul><h1 id=changelog>Changelog</h1><ul><li>2022-04-05:<ul><li>Changed ❓ from a clause modifier to a verb modifier. Removed clause modifier section.<li>Changed 👐 from 1st person plural to 3rd person.<li>Add substantive emoji 🔼.<li>Change adjective phrase emoji from ➰ and ➿ to ▶️ and ◀️.<li>Change descriptive phrase emoji from 〰️ to ⏩.</ul><li>2021-12-26:<ul><li>Changed descriptive clause emoji from 🔎 to 〰️.<li>Add adjective phrase ➰ (... ➿).<li>Classify descriptive clause emoji as emoji descriptor instead of a conjunction.<li>Remove integrator 🔗.<li>Add more examples and explain overall grammar more.</ul><li>2017: Initial version.
